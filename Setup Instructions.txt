Instructions for first time setup of GitHub:


1) Create an account here: https://github.com/join?source=header-home
	- You can use your NU email but feel free to use whatever email account, just remember which one you used.

2) Download this software: https://desktop.github.com/

3) Download this cheat sheet for all the commands: https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf
	- Initially, the only important ones are under "Make Changes," "Group Changes," and "Synchronize Changes."

4) Once you've passed on your email address to the previous owner and downloaded everything, open up the GitHub desktop app and log-in.
	- You can ignore the hint pop-ups.

5) Click on the "+" sign on the top left corner, and select the "Clone" option.

6) Click on the "BME390_WoundExudate" repository, and save it to your "\Documents\GitHub" folder. It should already be the default path for saving.

7) Congratulations! You've successfully setup GitHub on your computer.
